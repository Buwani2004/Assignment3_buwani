        <h2>World of Birds</h2>
        <p>
          Birds are very special animals that have particular characteristics
          which are common amongst all of them. For instance, all of them have
          feathers, wings and two legs. Similarly, all birds lay eggs and are
          warm-blooded. They are very essential for our environment and exist in
          different breeds.
        </p>
        <h3>Nightingale</h3>
        <p>
          Nightingales are slightly larger than Robins, with a robust,
          broad-tailed, rather plain brown appearance. They are secretive birds
          and extremely local in their distribution in the UK, while in much of
          southern Europe they are common and more easily seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the U.K., the bird is at the northern limit of its range which has
          contracted in recent years, placing it on the red list for
          conservation.[9] Despite local efforts to safeguard its favoured
          coppice and scrub habitat, numbers fell by 53 percent between 1995 and
          2008.[10] A survey conducted by the British Trust for Ornithology in
          2012 and 2013 recorded some 3,300 territories, with most of these
          clustered in a few counties in the southeast of England, notably Kent,
          Essex, Suffolk, and East and West Sussex.[11]
        </p>
        <h3>Eagle</h3>
        <p>
          Eagle is the common name for the golden eagle, bald eagle, and other
          birds of prey in the family Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several
          groups of genera, some of which are closely related. True eagles
          comprise the genus Aquila. Most of the 68 species of eagles are from
          Eurasia and Africa
        </p>
        <p>
          The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey.
          Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful. It is estimated that the
          wedge-tailed eagle has a visual acuity twice that of a typical
          human.[2][3][4] This acuity enables eagles to spot potential prey from
          a very long distance. This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to
          their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction
          (scattering) of the incoming light. Like most diurnal raptors, eagles
          have little ability to see ultraviolet light.[5] The female of all
          known species of eagles is larger than the male.[6][7]
